## About This Site
The purpose of this site is to walk you through setting up your system to work with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/), then finally host your Hugo site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with the help of [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

### *Once you complete this tutorial...*
- We hope that you enjoyed it and can see that Hugo is a really simple framework to use! 
- Hugo is great if you want to start a blog, create an online portfolio, or both. 
  - You can even make it in a tutorial/road-mappy way as we did for this site
  - Or, share videos or audio like we did for our podcast!
- There's so much more you can do with Hugo, we have just scraped the surface.
- But hopefully, you can see that you get to focus on your content by worrying less about setting up databases, for example.
