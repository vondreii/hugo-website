## Intro

In this tutorial, we will walk you through creating a blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo is a Static Site Generator that has [themes/layouts](https://themes.gohugo.io/) that have already been created by developers, which we will use to set up our website. 

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a hosting platform. It will be used to host your Hugo website, so that anyone can access your website on the Internet.

The reason we need [GitHub](https://github.com/) is because we need to store our Hugo code somewhere for Netlify to access.

## Pre-requisites

<!-- You will need to sign up for GitHub and Netlify accounts if you don't have them already and also install Git Bash on your devices. It is also useful to have a text editor, which is useful for viewing the project on. -->

- [ ]  Sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [ ]  Have a text editor! Any of the following will do:
    - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    - [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v7.9.5/) (Windows only)
    - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (used in this example)
- [ ]  Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - For Windows, leave the default settings when installing
    - For Mac, follow the Git installation process [here](/posts/2.-install-hugo-mac)
